Installation
This module is designed for use with Browserify (but should work with anything CommonJS compatible). You can easily install it with npm:




			npm install react-simple-dropdown







How to use
This module provides three React components that you can use as a basis for any kind of dropdown menu:

DropdownTrigger: The element that will cause your dropdown to appear when clicked.
DropdownContent: Contains the "filling" of your dropdown. Generally, this is a list of links.
Dropdown: The base element for your dropdown. This contains both the DropdownTrigger and the DropdownContent, and handles communication between them.
There is also a barebones stylesheet which must be included in order for the component to actually work.

Keep in mind that DropdownTrigger and DropdownContent must be direct children of Dropdown. Here's a quick example:

var React = require('react');
var Dropdown = require('react-simple-dropdown');
var DropdownTrigger = Dropdown.DropdownTrigger;
var DropdownContent = Dropdown.DropdownContent;

var Menu = React.createClass({
    render: function () {
        return (
            <Dropdown>
                <DropdownTrigger>Profile</DropdownTrigger>
                <DropdownContent>
                    <img src="avatar.jpg" /> Username
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/profile">Profile</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/favorites">Favorites</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/logout">Log Out</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </DropdownContent>
            </Dropdown>
        )
    }
});
Options
Options can be passed to Dropdown as props. A list of available options can be found below. These must be passed to the containing Dropdown component.
